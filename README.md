# DinoFormat

DinoFormat is a commit norm. Its goal is to provide an immediate understanding of what the commit does.


## Basic commits

A commit should always be prefixed by a symbole indicating its goal, which is separated by a pipe, followed by a short description of what the commit does.
A basic commit can be separated in 3 categories:

- ```+ | Added something``` - Example : When you add a feature.

- ```~ | Modified something``` - Example : When you modify a function or fix a bug.

- ```- | Removed something``` - Example : When you delete a deprecated function,or remove some assets.
